# Apple Health App Data Steps Analysis with Python and Seaborn (side project)
# Abstract
After reading many article that used data from Apple's health app. I wanted to try to create some data visualizations of test set count dataset. I used python, matplotlib and seaborn to analyze the step counts from the test data. I have included the work in a jupyter notebook file and the csv file that has the test data used for this side project.

This is box plot of steps by the days of the week.

You can look further in the code of this project in the repository.

# Challenges
The challenge for this project was to get data from an iphone to a readable format like a CSV file. Once that was done, it was a straightforward project.

# Conclusion
The size of the dataset was small but, it gave me a better way of looking at the progress daily steps. Using the Seaborn package was a great option to create some useful visualizations.
