# -Apple-Health-App-Data-Steps-Analysis-with-Python-and-Seaborn-side-project
After reading many article that used data from Apple's health app. I wanted to try to create some data visualizations of test set count dataset. I used python, matplotlib and seaborn to analyze the step counts from the test data. I have included the work in a jupyter notebook file and the csv file that has the test data used for this side project.
